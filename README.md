## How to Start (I have no idea of what I am doing)
- Have Python 3 installed obviously you noob.
- Install DJango [here how](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/install/)
- `pip` should come with the latest versions of Phyton (but what do I know, never done Phyton in my life) so check it you have it `pip3 --version` if you see errors and shit... well google how to install it.
- Do some `python manage.py migrate` inside the project folder for some extra magic to happen.
- create your own Admin user cus I'aint giving you shit data `python manage.py createsuperuser` please use as your user password a super secure password such as "1234" or "password" for extra security when creating your user.
- Run your server by using `python manage.py runserver`

## Trouble shooting:
